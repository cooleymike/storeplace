## Tests

You need to add automatic tests for your models to make sure they work as expected.

## Pyproject.toml

Create a new file called pyproject.toml.

```
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.hg
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | _build
  | buck-out
  | build
  | dist
)/
```

## Syntax check

I installed black to check the syntax and you can fix the followings:

```
21 files would be reformatted, 21 files would be left unchanged.
(venv) Laptop% black --check .
